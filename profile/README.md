# Hello!, Meet Undefined!

Welcome to our small Github "Organization"

Currently we are just dropping our useful little projects/code/snippet here that we are using to make a bigger project with! 
(hopefully it will help someone out) 

Please note that this information is not set in stone, it may be modified and changed later as the organization develops.

# Our Vision

Our end goal is to create a security centered OpenBSD competitor, but user freindly enough for the average non-techy user. It will be a micro-kernel based OS (made with rust), for mobile, ARM based devices that is shipped with WEB3 and privacy focused applications (w/ IOTA or another DAG network), with iOS-like finesse and PureOS-like real-convergence.

Not only will the OS include these features, included applications will remain unbranded and dual-licensed with the noharm (modified) and GNU 3 licenses (to encourage open-source, may be modified or changed later). 

# FAQ 

### What do you mean by unbranded? 

The programs (excluding the official project/OS as a whole) will have no official name/brand, all names used will be generalized (e.x. texting app is just messenger), allowing for maximum creativity and customization. 

The "undefined project" name will pop up in as little places as possible on the actual OS. 

### Approximately how long will this project take?

A heck of a long time, that's all the information we can give you, as we are currently only two programmers with a dream. The team will probably be expanded as the organization develops. 

### Why is the organization named "project undefined"?

To emphasize our lack of branding, it's a feature. 

### Are you accepting contributors?

Yes, but the process of contributing will be slow for now. We are still developing the requirements/guidelines.
