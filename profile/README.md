# Hello!, Meet Undefined!

Welcome to our small Github "Organization"

Currently we are just dropping our useful little projects/code/snippet here that we are using to make a bigger project with! 
(hopefully it will help someone out) 

Please note that this information is not set in stone, it may be modified and changed later as the organization develops.

# Our Vision

Our end goal is to create a security centered OpenBSD competitor. The OS will be user freindly enough for the average non-techy user, but with enough functionality to also work in cloud computing and in servers. It will be a micro-kernel based OS (made with rust), for mobile, ARM based devices that is shipped with WEB3 and privacy focused applications (w/ IOTA or another DAG network), with iOS-like finesse and PureOS-like real-convergence.

Not only will the OS include these features, it will be dual-licensed with the noharm (modified) and GNU 3 licenses (to encourage open-source, may be modified or changed later). 

# FAQ 

### Approximately how long will this project take?

A heck of a long time, that's all the information we can give you, as we are currently only two programmers with a dream. The team will probably be expanded as the organization develops. 

### Why is the organization named "project undefined"?

To emphasize our lack of application branding, it's a feature. 

### Are you accepting contributors?

Yes, but the process of contributing will be slow for now. We are still developing the requirements/guidelines.
